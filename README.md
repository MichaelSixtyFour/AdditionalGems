# Additional Gems
This mod is a set of removed blocks and items from my mod Materials Expanded that didn't fit with the theme that I have for that mod. Instead of throwing the hours of coding and texturing away I thought I'd spin it off from the mod and make it its own mod. This has been done a lot of times before but why not throw my hat into the ring?

Images of the blocks/items can be seen in the images tab.
